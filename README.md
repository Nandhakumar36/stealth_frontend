# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## build deployment

We deploy it to the cloud using AWS Amplify’s web hosting service. we will connect the repository to [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/module-one/?e=gs2020&p=build-a-react-app-intro) web hosting and deploy it to a globally available content delivery network (CDN) hosted on an amplifyapp.com domain.

* [Deploy app with AWS Amplify](#deploy-app-with-aws-amplify)

### Log into AWS Management Console

Open the AWS Management Console in a new browser window, so you can keep this step-by-step guide open. When the screen loads, enter your user name and password to get started. Then type "Amplify" in the search bar and select **AWS Amplify** to open the service console.

### Deploy app with AWS Amplify

In this step, you will connect the GitLab repository you just created to the AWS Amplify service. This will enable you to build, deploy, and host your app on AWS.

1. In the AWS Amplify service console, select "Get Started" under Deploy.
2. Select GitLab as the repository service and select Continue.
3. Authenticate with GitLab and return to the Amplify console. Choose the repository and specific branch you created earlier, then select Next.
4. Accept the default build settings and select Next.
5. Review the final details and select Save and Deploy.
6. AWS Amplify will now build your source code and deploy your app at https://...amplifyapp.com.
7. Once the build completes, select the thumbnail to see your web app up and running live.
